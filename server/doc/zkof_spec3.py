# synopsis spec of zero knowledge application framework.

# this is a draft. no code exists. just trying to make the interface intuitive
# and effective.  But I already wish, this had existed 5 years ago when I was
# writing the original SpiderOak!

# this demos client side operations, so everything is from the perspective of
# code running in a browser.  We'll demo the ways a developer would use the
# framework to build apps, rather than show the internal details of what the
# framework is doing behind the scenes.  We will attempt to descirbe those
# behind the scenes details (mostly about crypto, protocol, and internal data
# structures) in comments.

# we're using pseudocode rather correct javascript, because for purposes of
# understanding and iterating the concept quickly, I find this easier to read.
# Also, the spec is intended to be language agnostic, such tha clients could be
# developed in a variety of languages, and all interoperate.

# for similar reasons, this is written using synchronous code, whereas in a
# real app an async approach would usually be needed with callbacks and such,
# since many of the methods involve blocking network access, although the
# framework may do behind the scenes caching so blocking is reduced.  Since
# we're just trying to demo capabilities here and most people find synchronous
# code easier to read, we'll stick with that.

# === generating a new account (i.e. which implies a crypto context for object
# storage and communication with peers.)

# bob signs up for an account in our OMG awesome zero knowledge diary
# application.

# this locally generates an object containing root level keys, including an
# outer level session key derived from the pass phrase using a key derivation
# function.  Also creates public/private keypair, a HMAC key, a couple of salt
# strings, and a challenge key that can later be used for auth between
# client/server via a zero knowledge password proof.
account = zkaf.generate_account('pass phrase')
# account names can be whatever strings the server's policy allows. that's up
# to the server. account names are plain text.
account.name = 'account_name'
# this establishes a new account on the server with the given name. that
# name might not be available so check result.
if (result.status !== 'ok') {
    if (result.error !== 'dupe') {
        alert("can't create this account: " + result.errormessage)
        return
    }
    account.name = 'another account_name' # try again with a name that isn't taken
    result = account.save()
}

# now we have an account. we can securely store objects and data.

# === authenticating into an established account (establishing a crypto session
# in the context of an existing account.)
# this does a zero knowledge password proof auth to the server for the
# specified account, then retrieves the cipher text of our keys, decrypts them
# with the key from the KDF and the pass phrase, and therefore establishes a
# crypto session with access to our keys and authorization to retrieve our
# storage containers.
session = zkaf.auth('account_name', 'pass phrase')
if not session:
    # we don't necessarily get a clear message on why this failed, because
    # that would leak information
    raise RuntimeError("bad account name or password")

# === persisting a session
# caching the crypto session locally (HTML5 local storage?) so we don't have to
# prompt for password and derive keys again (which is expensive.)
session_as_string = session.serialize() # save this somewhere

# resurrect it later
zkaf.session.from_string(session_as_string)
# make sure that server believes this is still a valid account/session. (like
# if it's been persisted for a long time..)
result = session.ping()
# for example, the session might be invalid if the password has changed since
# it was saved, or if the account has been deleteded or disabled server side
# (such as for non-payment.)

# === changing a pass phrase for an account
session.account.pasphrase = 'new passprhase'
result = session.account.save()
# check the result -- you might get a version error if you don't have the
# newest version of the account at the time you try to save. (more on
# versioning later.)
if result == 'refresh':
    old_version = session.account.version()
    session.account.refresh()
    new_version = session.account.version()
    result = session.account.save()

# === introducing object storage via containers
# we're going to store our app's data using objects, like a traditional object
# database.  Many people are already familiar with object databases such as
# ZODB.  Our object database is a similar concept, while making zero knowledge
# privacy guarantees and also making it possible to selectively (and privately)
# share and collaborate with others.

# Objects are stored in containers.  Containers are always associated with a
# specific account (and unreadable by other accounts, unless explicitly shared
# with a peer or a group.)  Containers are a way of partitioning the data
# required for object storage. an app with relatively smallish data storage
# requirements might just use one container, and store every object in that
# container. other apps may use many separate containers.  A container must be
# fetched in its full length from the server and decrypted client side for the
# objects inside it to be read.

container = session.load('diary') # load this container from the server to
                                  # local, making access to all objects
                                  # available without blocking.  If the
                                  # container is already available in cache,
                                  # this returns immediately.

# containers are identified by keys such as 'diary' above. any string is
# allowed. From the server's perspective, container names (and of course their
# contents) are unreadable.

# If the data set is going to grow very large, partitioning data across
# containers and lazy loading them as you need them can help with app load
# time.  Behind the scenes, the framework does some local caching for the
# contents of frequently used storage containers, so it doesn't always have to
# download the full container when the app needs it.

# One simple tactic for partitioning data among containers is to keep app
# metadata all in one container, and keep bulky binary data (images, videos,
# long text strings, whatever) in many other containers.  Metadata is usually
# very small, and can load quickly.

# For example, a diary app might have a single metadata container with a list
# of entries. Each entry has a title, date, keywords, and other basic
# attributes.  Average size is probably under 500 bytes.  So one entry per day
# for 10 years would only be be 1.8 meg.  In 10 years, 1.8 meg will be like 1.8
# KB today, so storing all this in one container is fine.  Each entry would
# reference other containers to find the text of the entry and media
# attachments like images, videos, etc.


diary_entries = container.get("entries")
draft_entries = container.get("drafts")
# these objects are like regular javascript objects that we can store data
# into.
new_entry = { id: get_uuid(), title: "Adventures with Crypto" }
draft_entries.push(new_entry)
# atomically save all modified objects back to the container. if we had made
# changes to either diary_entries or draft_entries, both would be saved. the
# default parameters for saving objects preserves object history (i.e. previous
# versions of the object are still reachable) and uses diffing where
# appropritae to minimize the total size.
result = container.save()

# let's add some more content to this entry.  We'll store the text content
# separately from the metadata, in its own one-off container.
text = "we're having fun here in object storage land...."

new_entry.text_container_name = 'text_for_' + new_entry.id
text_container = session.new_container(new_entry.text_container_name)
text_container.add(new_entry.id, text)
text_container.save() # save our text to one the one-off container
container.save() # and save our changes to draft_entries from above to the main
                 # container. (later we'll show how to do both of these
                 # atomically in one op.)

# here's how we would iterate over all the entries in the diary, retrieving
# text and media attachments from their own containers.

# provided by the server. they aren't sortable client side.  a container's
# version identifier changes whenever modifications to a container and/or the
# objects in a container are saved.  When a container is loaded, it normally
# includes the complete change history of all objects in the container (but see
# below about compaction.)  This means that clients can see the history of
# objects in a container, and find the differences between them.

# refreshing objects, finding changes between times.

old_identifier = container.version_identifier()
container.refresh()
new_identifier = container.version_identifier()

    for entry in object_history:

        # these properties are added by the server, and are guaranteed to be
        # correct.
        entry.version_identifier # the new version of the container at the time
                                 # this object was changed. (note that many
                                 # objects in the container may share the same
                                 # version identifiers, since the identifier
                                 # applies to the entire container and all the
                                 # objects it changes; a transaction modifying
                                 # several objects would give the new versions
                                 # of those objects each the same new version

                        # compression, encryption, etc.)  In other words, the
                        # length of the ciphertext of the diff.

# === zero knowledge sharing of containers/objects with peers.
# you can share with an individual peer or with defined groups (below.) sharing
# happens by making objects available to peers or groups.  The objects continue
# to be unreadable to the server or to anyone other than the peers the objects
# are shared with.

# obligitory scenario of alice and bob wanting to communicate with crypto :)

alice = session.get_peer("alice")
if not alice:
    alert("peer alice not available")

# share an entire container (including all objects and their history since the
# last compaction) with alice.  share implies reads only, not writes.  alice
# will be able to read the historical and current state of all objects in this
# container as they are updated and changed until it is deleted or unshared.
container.share(alice)
# appropritate warnings about info theory here!
container.unshare()       # remove all sharing with all peers
container.unshare(alice)  # just remove alice
result = container.save() # still have to check for conflicts/retry, even
                          # though you're not changing any data.

# what really happens when bob unshares a container with alice?
#  - we tell the server to no longer make the contents of the container
#    readable to alice (i.e. so that alice is disallowed by the server
#    from retreving the encrypted data stream of the container.)
#  - we re-key the container such that all further writes to the container
#    continue to be unreadable to alice, even if alice happens to be Mallory's
#    girlfriend (and mallory is an evil system administrator employed by the
#    service operator, with administrative and physical access to the server(s)
#    the container is stored on.)
#  (information theory of course means that any data previously shared with
#  alice, alice already knows. so there's not much point in re-encrypting that
#  data.)

# share only a specific object with alice. like above, object will remain
# shared and the peer can see changes/updates/history.  this is more expensive
# than just sharing a whole container, but not excessively so.  From alice's
# perspective, it seems like the container only contains the specific objects
# that are shared.
myobject.share(alice)
myobject.unshare(alice)
myobject.save()

# how alice gets to this data (from her own session)
bob = session.get_peer("bob")
# get a container object for from peer
bob_container = bob.load("container_name")
# bob_container may have every key available to us (if bob shared the whole
# container), or just the specific keys that bob shared with us.  from alice's
# perspective, she can't tell the difference between a container that's fully
# shared vs. one that just has some shared objects in it.
bob_object = bob_container.get('bobs_object')

# now we could read bob's diary as above, just as if it was one of our own
# objects. We just can't save changes back to it.  (But more on that later...)

# === secure real time messages. this is not messages in the
# sense of email, but messages in the sense of message queues, or message
# oriented application development.  still, the inbox metaphore mostly fits.
# messages are async; the recipients don't have to be connected/online right
# now to receive these. they'll notice new messages whenever they next poll
# their inbox.

# allow our peer alice to send us stuff.

# TODO: resolve this question: should it be possible to blanket allow messages
# from anyone? maybe a limit of just a few small messages?
# proposed answer: make it easy to allow a small number of messages from
# anyone, and have that limit automatically go away if you send a message back.

# sending and checking message queues. we can send messages to ourselves, or to
# our peers that have set allow_messages from us.
# messages have these properties: id, from, to, timestamp, size, header, body, ttl
# messages are immutable -- they are only created, delivered, retrieved, and
#   deleted.
# they are never modified (not even in the sense that they are "marked as
#   read").  In that sense, in message queue terms, they have "at least once"
#   delivery semantics.
# header and body are encrypted such that only recipient can read them.
# the size property is the length of the ciphertext of headers + body
# headers may optionally be retrieved when the inbox contents is listed.
# headers are limited to 4k in size per message.
# the headers are really just an object. any javascript JSON object is allowed.
#   the size limitation is applied to the serialized, compressed, and encrypted
#   form of the object.
# the body is also an object, but without a hard limit.
# headers and body must be defined. it's conventional to send false as a value
#   when you don't need to send a particular value.
# searching or filtering through the listed messages by headers necessarily
#   takes place on the client side, since the server cannot decrypt them for
#   us.
# headers and body together count towards maximum message sizes that a peer
#   might be willing to receive from another peer (as configured above.)
