# Crypton

A framework for creating zero-knowledge web applications

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SpiderOak/crypton.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SpiderOak/crypton)

## What is Zero Knowledge?

Zero Knowledge applications offer meaningful privacy assurance to end users
because the servers running the application cannot read the data created and
stored by the application.

To learn more, check out the [Crypton website](https://crypton.io/).

## WARNING

This is an early stage project at v0.0.1 which is a proof of core concepts.  It
is not yet intended for production use until v0.1.0.  There are known serious
bugs and weaknesses.

Most importantly, it has not been through a first round of refactoring, general
code cleanup, and security review. It does not have comprehensive test
coverage.  All of these things will change in the versions between v0.0.1 and
v0.1.0, at which point we'll make a first stable release that we encourage for
production and commercial uses.

## Get Started

To get started with Crypton development, you will need node.js v0.10.x with npm,
and uglify-js. You will need a postgresql server running on localhost (or
edit the config file in the `server/` directory), and Redis.

You can check your system for the correct dependencies by running (in this directory):

sh ./check_dependencies.sh

Clone the repository and run `make` to install the rest of the dependencies and
run the tests.

## Documentation

There are files describing the high-level specification in the `client/doc/`
and `server/doc/` directories, but currently, the best way to get a complete
picture of the Crypton system is by understanding the database schema, in
`server/lib/stores/postgres/sql/setup.sql`, which has lots of explanatory
comments.
